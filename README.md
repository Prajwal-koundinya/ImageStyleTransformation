## ✨ **Overview**
This project harnesses the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to:

- 🎥 **Transform images** by applying styles from iconic artwork or personalized designs.
- 🧠 **Leverage VGG19**, a pre-trained neural network, to understand and extract critical content and style features.
- ⚡ **Merge art and technology**, enabling a seamless transition from computational algorithms to creative expression.

By adjusting parameters, you can experiment with different levels of content and style influence, crafting outputs tailored to your vision. Embark on this journey to combine the elegance of art history with the innovation of AI! 🎨

## 🌟 **Features**
✅ Effortlessly stylize images by merging artistic inspiration with personal content.

✅ Fine-tune weights for **content** and **style** to achieve the perfect balance.

✅ Compatible with high-resolution images, ensuring quality results.

✅ Minimal dependencies, enabling a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## ⚙️ **Setup**
Getting started is quick and easy:

1⃣ **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-style-transformation.git
   cd image-style-transformation
   ```

2⃣ **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3⃣ **Verify compatibility:** Ensure your Python environment is configured correctly. TensorFlow and related packages should be installed as specified.

## 🚀 **How to Use**
Follow these simple steps to transform your images:

1. **Prepare your images:** Place the base (content) image and the artistic (style) image into the `images` folder.

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python style_transfer.py --content_path path_to_content_image --style_path path_to_style_image
   ```

3. **Adjust parameters:**
   - 💭 `style_weight`: Increase this to amplify the influence of the style image.
   - 🖋️ `content_weight`: Adjust this to retain more features from the content image.

4. **Experiment and iterate:** Try different combinations to unlock endless creative possibilities!
